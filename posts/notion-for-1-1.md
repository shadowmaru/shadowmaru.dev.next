Recently I've started to have regular 1:1s with members on my team, as part of a transition to the
Engineering Manager role. I was having regular 1:1s with my manager also, so now things were starting
to get out of control: I had to have notes on all meetings, and some action points that were result
of those meetings. How could I keep things organized?

## Notion to the rescue!

Notion is a platform for organization and knowledge base. It has an interesting concept of **blocks**
that can be anything: a paragraph, a title, a list, a table and so on. It also has **templates**,
which you can use to create repetitive blocks, or sets of blocks.

How do I use Notion to organize my 1:1s?

### Linked databases for tasks

First, I create a main To Do list for everything work related, so I don't lose track of my tasks.
Then, I create a tag for each 1:1, and assign that tag for tasks that are related to that 1:1, like
"Buy conference tickets for Mary", with the tag "1:1 Mary".

Then I create a page for each person, containing the notes about each session, and the To Do list,
filtered by that tag that I created. You can do that by creating a **linked database**, getting data
from that main database, and filter it by tag. In this example, the tag is "1:1 Mary". That way, any
change I make in that task is reflected on all boards. Pretty cool!

### Template button

Another way to keep things organized is having notes of each 1:1 session. To speed up this, I've
created a template to add new 1:1 session notes, with a template button.

All you have to do is give the button a name, and write the blocks that will be created when you click
that button. Simple, but effective.

And the result is this:

### Example

The example I've shown here is available [at my Notion Workspace](https://shadowmaru.notion.site/1-1s-Example-fb8de172acd745318812c2fa5cc7d1eb). Remember to view the database as "Board View".
